# TODO for yesodweb.com-content

In general refer more the the Yesod Book.


## About

Breakdown 'about' into:
* Benefits of Yesod
* Yesod: designed to scale

The rest are:
* Yesod's features, that should be formulated as benefits and moved to
  the Benefits page
* Refs to other docs that can be moved directly to the homepage


## 5 minute getting started

Rename this to "Installing Yesod", as getting HP to work well might take
a lot more then 5 mins (lol!).

Update it to refer to HP 2011.4 as the development platform of choice as
of Mar'12.

## Contributors

split up in 'Team' and 'How to contribute'
